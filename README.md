# AcronisTools
Powershell Tools for Acronis.

At its core, this is really just a useful tool to search across all tenants for a specific client or partner.  Since Acronis has limits to how many clients/partners a tenant can house, you may be in a situation where you are responsible for clients/partners across a multitude of tenants.  Sometimes finding the right tenant can be time consuming when done manually, this tool aims to make that process easier.

## Prerequisites

### Microsoft Secret Store
AcronisTools uses the Microsoft Secret Store to securely store credentials and tokens for Acronis tenants.  In order to use this tool, you must first install the appropriate modules and configure your secret store.

First, install the required modules:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name "Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement" -AllowPrerelease
Install-Module -Name "Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore" -AllowPrerelease
```

Then, configure your API Client vault.  This will store your Acronis API Client credentials. You can name this whatever you like, the AcronisTools module will ask you to provide the name at runtime.
```powershell
Register-SecretVault -Name <AcronisSecretVault> -ModuleName "Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore"
```

## Installation


## Authentication

### Acronis API Client
You must be issued an [Acronis API Client](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/support/documentation/AcronisCyberCloud/index.html#creating-api-client.html), once a client has been issued to you, you will store the client in your secret vault.
```powershell
New-AcronisSecret -Name <TenantName> -Vault <AcronisSecretVault> -ClientID <AcronisAPIClientID> -BaseUri <AcronisBaseUri> -ClientSecret <AcronisAPIClientSecret>
```
You can add multiple API clients for multiple tenants into the secret vault, which can be used to search multiple tenants at the same time.
